	5.Add 1ml Accutase. 
	6.Incubate at 37*C 5min. or until cells have lifted and separated from the dish.
	7.Mix 2ml mTeSR + 3ul RI in a 15ml tube. 
	8.Add the mTeSR+RI (or CM+FGF+RI) to the cells. Transfer all in the 15ml tube. 
	9.Centrifuge 4min 1000rpm.
	10.Remove supernatant and resuspend on mTeSR(or CM)+ RI [Amount depends on your application; for cell counting use 1ml+1ul].
