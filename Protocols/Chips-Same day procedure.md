## Chips-Same day procedure
###Coat chip
1. Dilute Laminin to a concentration of 5ug/ml (1:20) in warm PBS+/+. 
* Place ~50ul of the solution in a 3.5cm dish.Transfer the chip to the dish by holding it with twizzers from the labeled corner and putting it upside down from the original position. (You should be able to read the label now). 
* Hold the chip against the bottom of the dish using the twizzers and add 2ml of the laminin solution.
* Incubate at 37* for 2 hours. (*After one hour add RI to the cells to improve the single cell suspension survival)
* Without removing the media, add 6ml of warm PBS+/+. 
* Remove only 6ml of solution and add 6ml of PBS+/+.
* Repeat  step 6, 5 times.   
	  The chip can be left in PBS +/+ until cells are ready to be seeded.
	  
###  Make single cell suspension.   
	1. Add 2ul of RI to a 2ml cell culture dish.
	
	2. Incubate 1hr. at 37*C (Cells should have a more spindly appearance). 
	
	1. Warm mTeSR+RI (or CM+FGF+RI) and Accutase at RT (Accutase: Stored at 4*C is good for 1 month).
	2. Remove media and wash with 2ml of PBS(-).
	3. Add 1ml Accutase. 
	4. Incubate at 37*C ~10min. or until cells have lifted and separated from the dish.
	5. Mix 2ml mTeSR + 3ul RI in a 15ml tube. 
	6. Add the mTeSR+RI (or CM+FGF+RI) to the cells. Transfer all in the 15ml tube. 
	7. Centrifuge 4min 1000rpm.
	8. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 1ml mTeSR+ 1ul RI (or CM+FGF+RI) 
	
### Count the cells
	
		1. Transfer 10ul to the hemocytometer.
		2. Count the cells on the 5x5 center square.
		3. Add 4 zeros to the number counted. That is the amount of cells in the 1ml solution. 
		
###Seed and Treat
9. Dilute desired amount of cells in 2ml of media(mTeSR or CM+FGF) +2ul RI +20ul P/S
    (amount of cell depends on the experiment, 900,000 to treat same day). 
10. Leave chip on the hood undisturbed for ~10 min before transferring to 37*C. 
11. After 1hr change the media without RI.
12. After aprox. 3h add BMP4 treatment (usually 50ng/ml).
13. Incubate at 37* for 42hrs.
14. Wash with 2ml of PBS(-).
15. Add 2ml of PFA4% to fix the cells.
16. Wash with PBS (-). 
Stain or store at 4*C, sealed with parafilm.
